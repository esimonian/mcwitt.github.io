In preparation for the upcoming job search (and because the coming months might
be a little hectic, I'm planning to finish my PhD in June) I just revamped my
personal webpage and learned some new tools in the process. The new site uses
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
a static site generator, which means that one can cleanly separate the layout
and content of a site and it generates the final HTML files that you see in the
browser. This makes adding content easy, removing most of the boilerplate code
(and accompanying room for error). For example, adding a blog post to the site
is as simple as dropping a new file (HTML, Markdown, etc.) file in the `_posts`
folder. I'm also using
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
for the UI elements (and, shamelessly,
[design inspiration](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/jumbotron/)).

The framework was easily set up in an afternoon, and already I feel the result
is much easier on the eyes and more maintanable than my previous attempt, which
I hand-coded in HTML. Now for gratuitous equations!

<div>
$$(O^{-1} L^{-2} E^{-1} H^{-1})^{-1}!$$
$$H=-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j$$
</div>

(and code)


{% highlight python %}
from pylab import *

def jackknife(X):
  return (X - sum(X))/(len(X)-1)
{% endhighlight %}
