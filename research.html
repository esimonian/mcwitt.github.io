<p>
  I study "complex systems", in which relatively simple interactions
  between a large number of entities give rise to complex "emergent"
  behavior which is often difficult to understand from first principles.
</p>
<p>
  Mainly I have worked on models of "spin glasses", magnetic materials with
  disordered (random) interactions between their constituent atoms or molecules.
  Although spin-glass models were originally invented to capture the essential
  physics of real materials in a lab, they quickly became a field of study in
  their own right as it was realized that they are among the simplest models
  displaying universal signatures of complex systems. Analytical and numerical
  tools originally developed in the study of spin glasses have been applied
  successfully in diverse fields, notably in the study of neural networks and
  general-purpose optimization algorithms.
