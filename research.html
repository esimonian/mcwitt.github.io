  I use computer simulations to gain a insight into the physics of
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">complex systems</a>
  for which analytic solutions have so far been unavailable. With my PhD adviser
  <a href="http://young.physics.ucsc.edu/">Dr. A. Peter Young</a>
  I have studied spin glasses, finite-size scaling in high-dimensional
  systems, and classical optimization problems.
</p>
<p>
  In collaboration with Dr. Young and 
  <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~hen/">Dr. Itay Hen</a>
  I have studied quantum algorithms, specifically an algorithm to solve
  the graph isomorphism problem using a quantum annealer.

<h3>Spin glasses in the nonextensive regime</h3>

    Classical spin systems with long-range interactions are
    useful models in a diverse range of topics, from magnetic materials to neural
    networks. Of particular interest are models in which the interactions between
    spins decay as an inverse power of their spatial separation. When the exponent
    is smaller in magnitude than the number of spatial dimensions, the free energy
    grows faster than the number of spins; that is, the free energy is
    nonextensive. The thermodynamic limit does not exist in this case.

    It has been conjectured for ferromagnets
    <a href=http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.54.R12661>[1]</a>
    and more recently for spin glasses
    (disordered systems with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
    interactions)
    <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4920>[2]</a>
    that mean-field theory provides exact results not just in the
    infinite-range limit but also throughout the nonextensive regime.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have shown that the transition temperatures obtained by Monte Carlo
    simulation agree to high precision with the predictions of mean-field theory,
    thus providing strong evidence for the conjectures.
