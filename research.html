  I study "complex systems", in which relatively simple interactions
  between a large number of entities give rise to complex "emergent"
  behavior which is often difficult to understand from first principles.
</p>
<p>
  Mainly I have worked on models of "spin glasses", magnetic materials with
  disordered (random) interactions between their constituent atoms or molecules.
  Although spin-glass models were originally invented to capture the essential
  physics of real materials in a lab, they quickly become a field of study in
  their own right as it was realized that they are among the simplest models
  displaying universal signatures of complex systems. Analytical and numerical
  tools originally developed in the study of spin glasses have been applied
  successfully in diverse fields, notably in the study of neural networks and
  general-purpose optimization algorithms.

    Classical spin systems with long-range interactions are
    useful models in a diverse range of topics, from magnetic materials to neural
    networks. Of particular interest are models in which the interactions between
    spins decay as an inverse power of their spatial separation. When the exponent
    is smaller in magnitude than the number of spatial dimensions, the free energy
    grows faster than the number of spins; that is, the free energy is
    nonextensive. The thermodynamic limit does not exist in this case.

    It has been conjectured for ferromagnets
    <a href=http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.54.R12661>[1]</a>
    and more recently for spin glasses
    (disordered systems with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
    interactions)
    <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4920>[2]</a>
    that mean-field theory provides exact results not just in the
    infinite-range limit but also throughout the nonextensive regime.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have shown that the transition temperatures obtained by Monte Carlo
    simulation agree to high precision with the predictions of mean-field theory,
    thus providing strong evidence for the conjectures.
